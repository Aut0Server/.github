### 🗃️ AutoServer 🗃️
**The Ultimate Server Automation Bot**

AutoServer strives to make deleting & rebuilding Discord servers faster & easier than ever. Currently, the only way to delete
all channels in a Discord server is by manually deleting each and every one of them, and the only way to rebuild a server is by
adding and configuring each channel and category seperately.

However, with the help of ChatGPT and Google Pa-LM, we have made it possible to rebuild any server with a server template, rebuilding
a server within mere seconds, and have also made it possible to delete every channel instantly, including specific channels. All of 
these features are 100% free - no card verification, payments, or credits.

Don't fret - AutoServer is built with maximum security in mind. Instead of only needing the bot invite permissions, you must have administrator
or a series of all select roles (some include manage server, manage emojis, manage webhooks, etc.), making it usable to only those who have access
by default to delete or rebuild a server.
